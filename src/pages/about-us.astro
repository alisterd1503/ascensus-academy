            Ascensus Academy was founded to revolutionise the future of tutoring.
            <br>
            We believe the traditional education system needs an upgrade.

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-700">
            That’s why we only hire undergraduate tutors who have personally achieved an A* at A-level in the subject they teach.
            They’ve not only been through the system recently; they’ve mastered it.

          At Ascensus Academy every student is paired with a personalised mentor: a high-achieving university student studying a similar course pathway. Mentors provide free guidance on personal statements, interviews, and student life, sharing insights from their own experiences to help pupils feel prepared, inspired, and supported at every step.
